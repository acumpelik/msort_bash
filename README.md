Bash scripts that automate backing up data, processing it, and running Mountainsort on it.

- the **preproc** files are inherited from Heloisa and others, as is **mec_processing**, **mountain_to_sgclustb**, **mountsortb**, and **preprocessing3-mountainsort_yosman**
- **parallel_process_args** is a text file that goes with preproc2 and others (created by Heloisa), I haven't needed **preproc_args** yet
- **genbaselist** generates a list of filenames in JCXXX-YYYYMMDD_0x format in a file named BASELIST
