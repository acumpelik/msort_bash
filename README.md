Bash scripts that automate running Mountainsort on all recording sessions for one animal

- the preproc files are inherited from Heloisa and others, as is mec_processing, mountain_to_sgclustb.py, mountsortb, and preprocessing3-mountainsort_yosman
- parallel_process_args is a text file that goes with preproc2 and others (created by Heloisa), I haven't needed preproc_args yet
- genbaselist generates a list of filenames in JCXXX-YYYYMMDD_0x format in a file named BASELIST
